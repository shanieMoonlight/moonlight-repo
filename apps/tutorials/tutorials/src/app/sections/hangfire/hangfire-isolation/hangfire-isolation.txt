Summary: Independent Hangfire Setup for MyId Library
The goal of your setup in AddMyIdHangfireJobs is to ensure that your MyId library uses its own dedicated Hangfire instance (database schema, queues, server) that operates completely independently of any other Hangfire instances running in the parent application or other libraries. This prevents jobs from being misrouted or interfering with each other.

Key Components and Why They Are Used:

Dedicated SqlServerStorage with SchemaName:

What:
C#

var storageOptions = new SqlServerStorageOptions { SchemaName = IdInfrastructureConstants.Jobs.Schema };
var myIdHfStorage = new SqlServerStorage(options.ConnectionString, storageOptions);
Why: This is the absolute first step for isolation. By assigning a unique SchemaName (e.g., "MyIdHangfireJobs") to your SqlServerStorage instance, you ensure that MyId's Hangfire tables (jobs, queues, etc.) are physically separated in the database from any other Hangfire instances (which typically use the default "Hangfire" schema). This prevents job data from being mixed up.
Keyed JobStorage Registration:

What:
C#

services.AddKeyedSingleton(IdInfrastructureConstants.Jobs.DI_StorageKey, myIdHfStorage);
Why: In an ASP.NET Core application with Dependency Injection (DI), multiple libraries might want to use Hangfire. The default services.AddHangfire() call (used by other parts of the application) will register a JobStorage instance as a non-keyed service. If you also registered myIdHfStorage as a non-keyed JobStorage, you'd run into the "last one wins" problem. The last JobStorage registered would become the application-wide default. By using AddKeyedSingleton, you register myIdHfStorage with a unique key. This tells the DI container: "This is the specific JobStorage instance for MyId, and it can only be retrieved by explicitly requesting this key." This is foundational for preventing conflicts in DI resolution.
Dedicated Hangfire Server Configuration:

What:
C#

services.AddHangfireServer((provider, config) =>
{
    config.ServerName = IdInfrastructureConstants.Jobs.Server;
    config.Queues = IdInfrastructureConstants.Jobs.Queues.All;
}, myIdHfStorage); // Explicitly use myIdHfStorage
Why: A Hangfire server actively processes jobs from a JobStorage. By passing myIdHfStorage directly to AddHangfireServer, you ensure that this specific server instance will only listen to and process jobs stored in MyId's dedicated database schema and queues. It will not touch jobs belonging to other Hangfire instances. Assigning a unique ServerName also helps in monitoring and debugging.
HangfireStorageProvider (Abstraction for Keyed Storage Access):

What:
C#

internal class HangfireStorageProvider(
    [FromKeyedServices(IdInfrastructureConstants.Jobs.DI_StorageKey)] SqlServerStorage storage)
{
    public JobStorage Storage { get; private set; } = storage;
}
services.AddScoped<HangfireStorageProvider>();
Why: This is a fantastic abstraction layer. Instead of every manager (HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr, HfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr) needing to know about the DI_StorageKey and [FromKeyedServices], you encapsulate that knowledge within HangfireStorageProvider.
It centralizes the retrieval of myIdHfStorage.
It makes the constructors of your job managers cleaner and more focused.
If the way myIdHfStorage is registered ever changes, you only need to update HangfireStorageProvider, not all your managers.
Dedicated Manager Wrappers (e.g., HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr, HfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr):

What:
C#

internal interface IHfRecurringJobMgr { /* methods */ }
internal interface IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr : IHfRecurringJobMgr; // and similar for BackgroundJobMgr

internal abstract class AHfRecurringJobMgr(HangfireStorageProvider storageProvider, string queue) : IHfRecurringJobMgr
{
    private readonly RecurringJobManager _recurringJobManager = new(storageProvider.Storage); // Direct instantiation
    // ... delegation of methods ...
}

internal class HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr(HangfireStorageProvider storageProvider)
    : AHfRecurringJobMgr(storageProvider, IdInfrastructureConstants.Jobs.Queues.Default), IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr
{ }

services.AddScoped<IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr, HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr>();
services.AddScoped<IHfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr, HfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr>();
Why: This is the core of how you achieve isolation for job enqueuers and managers:
Implement Standard Hangfire Interfaces: By having your managers implement IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr (which likely inherits IRecurringJobManager from Hangfire, or at least mirrors its methods) and IHfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr (mirroring IBackgroundJobClient), you allow your consuming services to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
Direct Instantiation from Keyed Storage: Inside your abstract base classes (AHfRecurringJobMgr), you directly create new RecurringJobManager(storageProvider.Storage) or new BackgroundJobClient(storageProvider.Storage). This is paramount! It ensures that the client/manager instances your library uses are explicitly built using your myIdHfStorage, bypassing any default clients/managers registered by services.AddHangfire().
DI Registration: services.AddScoped<IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr, HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr>(); (and similar for background) tells the DI container: "When anyone asks for IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr, give them my specific HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr instance." This ensures your MyId services get the correct, isolated manager.
IMyIdJobService and HangFireJobService (Consumer Layer):

What:
C#

internal class HangFireJobService(IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr recurringMgr, IHfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr backgroundMgr) : IMyIdJobService
{ /* ... delegates to managers ... */ }
services.AddScoped<IMyIdJobService, HangFireJobService>();
Why: This is the application-facing service.
It injects your isolated manager interfaces (IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr, IHfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr). It has no knowledge of JobStorage keys or Hangfire's internal workings.
It provides a high-level, business-oriented API for scheduling and managing jobs within the MyId domain.
Its dependency on interfaces makes it highly testable (you can easily mock IHfDefaultRecurringJobMgr etc. in unit tests) and loosely coupled.
What Happens in services.AddHangfire() Under the Hood (and Why We Avoided It)
When a parent application or another library calls services.AddHangfire(configuration => { configuration.UseSqlServerStorage(...) });, here's a simplified view of what happens:

Default JobStorage Registration: It registers a JobStorage instance based on the provided configuration (e.g., pointing to the default "Hangfire" schema). Crucially, it registers this as a non-keyed singleton (services.AddSingleton<JobStorage>(...)).
Default Client/Manager Factories: It registers IBackgroundJobClientFactory and IRecurringJobManagerFactory.
Default IBackgroundJobClient / IRecurringJobManager Registration: It then uses these factories to register non-keyed singletons for the main Hangfire interfaces:
C#

// Simplified view of what AddHangfire does
services.TryAddSingletonChecked(static x => x.GetService<IBackgroundJobClientFactory>().GetClient(x.GetService<JobStorage>()));
// And similarly for IRecurringJobManager
This means it resolves the default JobStorage and creates a default IBackgroundJobClient (and IRecurringJobManager) based on it, making them available for general injection.
Why we had to avoid relying on it:

"Last One Wins" Conflict: As explained, if both MyId's setup and MyIdDemo's AddHangfire() registered non-keyed IBackgroundJobClient instances, the one registered last would win. This would lead to jobs from MyId being enqueued in MyIdDemo's schema (or vice-versa), breaking isolation.
Lack of Specificity: We needed to guarantee that MyId's components always talked to myIdHfStorage, not whatever JobStorage happened to be the default. services.AddHangfire() doesn't inherently support multi-tenancy or specific JobStorage instances for its registered clients/managers directly without external workarounds.
How services.AddScoped<IBackgroundJobClient>(provider => new BackgroundJobClient(myIdHfStorage)); (and similar for IRecurringJobManager) was considered earlier:
This line was a direct attempt to solve the problem by saying: "Explicitly register an IBackgroundJobClient that uses myIdHfStorage."

Solves a large part of the problem: Yes, it ensures that an IBackgroundJobClient instance connected to myIdHfStorage exists in DI. If MyId's setup runs after the default AddHangfire(), it would override the default and make MyId's client the application-wide default. This would make MyId's jobs go to the right place.

Why it was insufficient (or not the final best practice):

Still Prone to Order Issues (Inverse): If MyId's setup ran before the default AddHangfire(), MyId's client would be immediately overridden by the default, sending MyId's jobs to the wrong place. This doesn't provide reliable, order-independent isolation.
Lacked Abstraction/Flexibility: It's a direct registration of a concrete Hangfire client. It doesn't allow for the wrapper classes (HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr etc.) to introduce custom logic, metrics, or other features that you might want to add around the Hangfire client, without modifying the core DI registration or the consumer.
Your current solution, by using HangfireStorageProvider and having HfDefaultRecurringJobMgr/HfDefaultBackgroundJobMgr implement their own interfaces and take the HangfireStorageProvider directly, is the most robust and elegant way to build and expose your isolated Hangfire clients to your MyId services. It completely sidesteps the "last one wins" problem for clients/managers and promotes excellent design principles.
