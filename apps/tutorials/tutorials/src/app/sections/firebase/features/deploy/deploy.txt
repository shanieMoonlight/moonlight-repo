Okay, let's go through your summary point by point. You've got a really solid understanding, and you're asking precisely the right questions to clarify the nuances!
Your summary is very close and captures the core concepts beautifully. Let's just refine a couple of things:
You said: "I assign a target in my git_action. This git_action.target is used to locate the deployment config in firebase.json . (where the files to deploy are located, what to ignore, etc.)"
Response: Absolutely correct! The target parameter in your GitHub Action ( spider-baby-hub-demo ) tells the Firebase CLI which specific configuration block within the hosting array of your firebase.json file to use. This is where it finds details like the public directory, ignore rules, rewrites , etc., for this specific deployment .
You said: "In the git_action I also assign a projectId. This git_action.projectId is used to tell the 'Deployer' where in Firebase the files will go (what project)."
Response: Spot on! The projectId parameter ( spider-baby-hub ) tells the Firebase CLI which overall Firebase Project in the cloud this deployment is intended for. All subsequent actions the CLI takes (like looking up targets, accessing services) will be within the context of this specific project.
You said: "There may be multiple apps in a single project and in order to decide where exactly with the firebase project we should be deploying to the following happens.
The 'Deployer' goes to .firebaserc.
It selects the "targets" object.
It uses the git_action.projectId to find the specific target object for that project.
It then goes to the hosting section of the target object and uses the git_action.target to find the name of the target with the project that the files are sent to."
Response: This is exactly right! This describes the crucial step where the CLI translates the user-friendly target name (from firebase.json and the deploy command) into the actual Firebase Resource ID (the Hosting Site ID in this case). The .firebaserc file holds this mapping, nested under the projectId . So, the flow is: projectId sets the project context -> look in .firebaserc under that projectId 's targets -> find the hosting targets -> use the target name ( spider-baby-hub-demo ) to find the corresponding Hosting Site ID ( spider-baby-hub in your example's .firebaserc ). This Site ID is the specific destination within the project.
So far, you've totally nailed it!
You said: "I only have one app in each project and i don't remember assigning an id to them so the default id is just the project name????? (I'm not sure about this one)"
Response: This is a great observation and touches on how Firebase Hosting works initially!
When you enable Firebase Hosting for the first time in a brand new Firebase project, Firebase automatically creates a default Hosting site. The ID for this default site is indeed the same as your Firebase Project ID . So, spiderbabymaterialtheming project's default Hosting site ID is spiderbabymaterialtheming . spider-baby-hub project's default Hosting site ID is spider-baby-hub , and so on.
However , if you were to create additional Hosting sites within the same Firebase project (which is why deploy targets for Hosting are so useful!), those additional sites would get different IDs (usually derived from your project ID, like your-project-id-another-site ).
The firebase target:apply hosting TARGET_NAME RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER command is what explicitly creates the mapping in your .firebaserc . You provide the TARGET_NAME you want to use in firebase.json and the command, and you provide the RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER , which is the actual Hosting Site ID as listed in your Firebase project .
Looking at your .firebaserc , under "spider-baby-hub" 's targets, you have "spider-baby-hub-demo": ["spider-baby-hub"] . This mapping says the target name "spider-baby-hub-demo" points to the Hosting Site ID "spider-baby-hub" . In this specific case, because "spider-baby-hub" is likely the default Hosting Site ID for the "spider-baby-hub" project, the Site ID happens to match the project ID. But this isn't a hard rule for all sites within a project, just the initial default one.
In Summary of the Refined Flow:
GitHub Action ( firebase deploy ... --project <projectId> --only <service>:<targetName> ): You tell the action the projectId and the targetName .
Firebase CLI:
Sets the context to the specified projectId .
Looks in the local .firebaserc file under the targets section for that projectId .
Finds the mapping for the specified service ( hosting ) and targetName ( spider-baby-hub-demo ).
Retrieves the actual Firebase Resource ID (the Hosting Site ID, which is "spider-baby-hub" in this example) from that mapping.
Goes to the firebase.json file, finds the configuration block for the specified service ( hosting ) with the matching targetName ( "spider-baby-hub-demo" ).
Uses the configuration details from that block ( public , rewrites , etc.) to deploy the files to the Hosting Site identified by the Resource ID ( "spider-baby-hub" ) within the specified Firebase Project ( "spider-baby-hub" ).
You've absolutely got the right idea. The .firebaserc is the bridge that translates your friendly target names (used in firebase.json and deploy commands) into the specific Firebase resource IDs within a given project.
Great questions! It shows you're thinking deeply about how the pieces fit together.


Ah, the Hosting Site ID! That's another key identifier, and it's directly related to the URL you mentioned.
The Hosting Site ID is simply the unique name you give to a specific Firebase Hosting site within your project. This ID is used to generate the default Firebase-provided subdomains for that site.
Looking at your project spider-baby-hub and the URL spider-baby-hub.web.app , the Hosting Site ID is right there in the URL itself!
Your Hosting Site ID for the site serving spider-baby-hub.web.app is spider-baby-hub .
For the default Hosting site that gets created with a new project, Firebase often recommends using the project ID as the Site ID, which is exactly what you have here!
So, the App ID is for your application (like the web app instance), and the Hosting Site ID is for the specific place (the Hosting site) where you're deploying your web content.
Hope that clarifies the difference and helps you find the ID you need! Let me know if anything else comes up!
