    <h1>Seasonal Themes</h1>
    <p>
      Explore different themes inspired by the seasons. Each card below uses the
      <code>ThemeGeneratorService</code> to apply its specific theme locally,
      without affecting the rest of the application or the other cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking "Go to [Season]" will navigate to a dedicated page for that season
      and apply the theme globally using the <code>ThemeService</code>, demonstrating
      full-page theme transitions.
