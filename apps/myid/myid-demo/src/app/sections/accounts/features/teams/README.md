# Teams Table Feature

This feature provides a CRUD table for managing teams, using a state service and forms for add/update, following the same pattern as the MntcTeam feature.

- Uses `TeamsTableStateService` for state management
- Uses `SbTeamFormComponent` for add/update forms
- Uses `CrudTableComponent` for displaying the table

See `teams-table.component.ts` for usage details.
