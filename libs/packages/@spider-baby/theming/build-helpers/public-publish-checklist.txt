# Moonlight Public NPM Publishing Checklist

## 1. Check All Package Names
- All `package.json` names must be npm-compliant (one slash for scope, e.g. `@spider-baby/utils-download`).

## 2. Update Versions
- Bump the `version` in each `package.json` (npm does not allow re-publishing the same version).

## 3. Check Peer and Direct Dependencies
- All internal dependencies (helper libs) must also be published to npm, and their names/versions must match in all `package.json` files.

## 4. Build All Packages
- Run `nx build <lib-name>` for each package, or just build the main lib (Nx will build dependencies).

## 5. Test Locally (Optional but recommended)
- Use `npm pack` and install tarballs in a test app to verify everything works.

## 6. Login to NPM
- Run `npm login` (if not already logged in).

## 7. Publish Helper Libraries First
- In each helper lib’s dist folder, run:
  ```
  npm publish --access public
  ```
  (Repeat for all helper libs.)

## 8. Publish Main Library Last
- In the main lib’s dist folder, run:
  ```
  npm publish --access public
  ```

## 9. Test Install from NPM
- In a clean project, run:
  ```
  npm install @spider-baby/material-theming
  ```
  (npm will fetch all dependencies automatically.)

## 10. Final Checks
- Check your package on https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spider-baby/material-theming
- Update documentation, changelogs, and version numbers as needed.

**Tip:**
- You can automate the publish steps with a script if you have many packages.
- Always check for errors or warnings after each publish step.
