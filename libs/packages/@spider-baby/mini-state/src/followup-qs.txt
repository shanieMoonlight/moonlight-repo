Update merge semantics: Currently update merges { ...a, ...action.payload.input, ...(action.payload.output ?? {}) } (prefers server output). Add a short unit test covering cases: full updated item returned, partial output, and 204/no-body (ensure fallback works).
    - This is designed to work with any observable , not just http-calls.  If the server returns no content , won't just end up using the input data. If the server returns a real objedct then we overwrite the input (fileds like : updatedOnUtc,updatedBy, etc ). Is that correct?

Runtime safety for DTOs: Builder and create rely on generics to prevent id in CreateItemDto. For fake APIs you already added defensive merging — good. Consider a small runtime strip of id as defensive coding when merging external data.
    - Can you elaborate on this

Naming / public API: MiniCrudStateNew is descriptive for development but may confuse consumers. If this is the public API consider renaming back to MiniCrudState (or add an exported alias) to avoid breaking changes.
	-We will revert to MiniStateCrud for the name and delete the old MiniStateCrud when everything works and the tests pass.
	

Builder lifecycle: MiniCrudStateBuilder injects DestroyRef in multiple new MiniState(..., inject(DestroyRef)) calls — that’s fine inside Angular, but document that builder must be used inside an Angular DI context (or accept a DestroyRef parameter to make it more flexible/testable).
	- should we create our own DestroyRef in MiniCrudStateBuilder and pass it to set**State methods. We could add an optional destroyer:DestroyRef paramater to Create and do _builderDestoyer = destroyor ?? inject(DestroyRef)

Error typing: combinedStates is typed any in setupCombinedSubscriptions. If possible, tighten that type to the combined MiniState shape to get better compile-time checks.
    - Can you elaborate on this

ShareReplay / concurrency: If multiple subscribers will consume data$, consider whether shareReplay or caching is needed on dataAndInput$ upstream (leave if MiniState already handles it).
    - we could add sharereplay(1), where should we put it
