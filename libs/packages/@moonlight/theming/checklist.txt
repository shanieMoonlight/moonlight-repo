Theming Package Review for NPM Publishing
I'll provide a comprehensive review of the @moonlight/theming library structure to prepare it for NPM publishing. Here's what to check across all projects:

1. Package Structure & Organization
Entry Points: Ensure each secondary entry point (like /selector) has:

Proper barrel files (index.ts)
Clear README.md files
Proper package.json configuration
Naming Conventions:

Check for consistency (ThemeGeneratorService vs other services)
Ensure folder/file naming follows Angular guidelines
Public API Surface:

Mark internal APIs with /** @internal */ comments
Remove direct imports from implementation files (use barrel exports)
2. Documentation
Top-Level README:

Add installation instructions
Include basic usage examples
Document all entry points
Component/Service Documentation:

Check JSDoc comments for exported classes
Include examples for key functionality
Demo Application:

Consider creating a demo app showing theme capabilities
3. Code Quality
Type Safety:

Replace any with proper types (like in _memoizedGeneratePalettes!: (...args: any[]) => GeneratedPalettes;)
Add proper interfaces for all public methods
Error Handling:

Add proper error handling for operations that might fail
Validate inputs in public methods
Optimizations:

Look for other expensive operations to memoize
Check for redundant DOM operations
4. Testing
Test Coverage:

Ensure all exported APIs have tests
Fix the failing memoization test we found
Add integration tests across services
Edge Cases:

Test with various theme configurations
Test with server-side rendering (SSR)
5. Build Configuration
Package.json:

Verify peer dependencies (Angular, etc.)
Set proper version ranges
Include proper metadata
Bundling:

Configure proper tree-shaking
Set up proper secondary entry points
Angular Package Format:

Ensure compliance with APF
Check compatibility with Ivy
6. SSR Compatibility
Platform Detection:
Check all browser-specific code uses proper guards
Verify DOM operations are protected by isPlatformBrowser
7. Specific Issues Found
Based on our previous exploration of the ThemeGeneratorService:

Memoization Key Issue:

Update key generation to be consistent across all services
Document expected cache behavior
Documentation Gaps:

Add more detailed explanations of theming concepts
Document customization options
Debug Code:

Remove any console.log statements from production code
Consider a debug mode toggle
TODO Comments:


Remove or fix any remaining TODOs

Redo : devLog



MOre tests. 

Update readme
Mention Dynamic config 
Finish Dynamic config 

Provide full list of colors
Mention ThemeTransitionService and ThemeTransitionIndicatorComponent


In season-home show the pallete , draw a diagram of the app structure and show how theming can be localized to sections
