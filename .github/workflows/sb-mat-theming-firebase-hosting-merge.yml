      # --- Use your custom setup action here! ---
      # This single step replaces:
      # - Set up Node.js
      # - Cache root node_modules
      # - Cache functions node_modules
      # - Cache Nx cache
      # - Install Dependencies (root)
      # - Install Dependencies (functions)

        # Use the path to your composite action relative to the repository root
        # Using @main is simple for development, for stability consider using a tag like @v1
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-build-env # Or replace @main with a tag like @v1 if you've tagged your action

        # Optional: Pass inputs if you want to override the defaults in action.yml
        with:
          node-version: '22' # Explicitly set the Node.js version

      # --- The custom action has now set up Node.js, restored caches, and installed dependencies ---


      # Keep the remaining steps as they rely on the environment and dependencies
      # set up by the custom action.
