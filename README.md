- Modular, with extensions for CRUD and combined state
- Minimal boilerplate, easy integration

```bash
npm install @spider-baby/mini-state
```

#### Key Features:
- ðŸ”„ **Reactive state management** with both RxJS Observables and Angular Signals
- ðŸš¦ **Built-in loading states** for async operations
- ðŸš¨ **Error handling** with customizable error messages

## UI Component Libraries

### [spider-baby-ui-kit](libs/ui/ui-kit)
A comprehensive UI component library providing reusable, modular Angular components:
- **Component Categories:** Buttons, checkboxes, inputs, modals, progress bars, ripple effects, selects, tables, tooltips, and more
- **Utilities & Types:** Shared helpers and type definitions for UI components
- **Testing & Configuration:** Includes Jest, ESLint, and TypeScript configs for robust development

Run its unit tests with:
```
nx test spider-baby-ui-kit
```

## Authentication & Identity

### [@spider-baby/auth-signal](libs/auth/auth-signal)
A feature-rich Angular library for JWT-based authentication, designed for modern Angular apps using signals.
- **Reactive JWT Authentication:** Converts JWT tokens into Angular signals for real-time, reactive UI updates
- **Type-Safe Claims Access:** Strongly typed JWT payloads with extensible interfaces
- **Automatic Token Expiry:** Built-in detection and handling of token expiry
- **Cross-Platform Storage:** Supports both synchronous and asynchronous storage (browser, Ionic, etc.)
- **Auth Guards & Role-Based Access:** Easy role and permission checking for route guards and UI components
- **Universal Support:** Works in browser, Node.js, and mobile environments
- **Multiple Implementations:** Ready-to-use for Firebase, custom auth systems, and more

Install:
```bash
npm install @spider-baby/auth-signal
```

### [spider-baby-auth-jwt-utils](libs/auth/jwt-utils)
- Utility functions for working with JWTs in Angular
- Used internally by other auth libraries (like `auth-signal`)

Run its unit tests with:
```
nx test spider-baby-auth-jwt-utils
```

### MyID Core Packages (`libs/myid`)

The `libs/myid` folder contains the core packages for the MyID authentication and identity system, designed for modular, enterprise-grade authentication flows:

- **spider-baby-myid-auth**: Provides authentication logic, services, and guards for the MyID system. This is the main entry point for integrating MyID authentication into your Angular applications. Includes support for advanced flows such as two-factor authentication, user management, and session handling.
- **spider-baby-myid-io**: Contains IO and API models, DTOs, and interfaces for the MyID system. This package standardizes the data contracts and communication between frontend and backend services, ensuring type safety and consistency.
- **spider-baby-myid-ui**: Offers a suite of UI components and utilities for building user interfaces around MyID authentication. Includes ready-to-use components for login, registration, password reset, two-factor verification, and more, all designed to be easily integrated and customized.

Each package is independently testable with Nx. For example:
```
nx test spider-baby-myid-auth
nx test spider-baby-myid-io
nx test spider-baby-myid-ui
```

## Other Libraries

- The `libs/ui`, `libs/utils`, `libs/tools`, and other folders contain additional UI components, utilities, and developer tools, each organized as independent libraries or modules.
- The `libs/packages` folder is the main location for publishable npm packages under the `@spider-baby` scope.
